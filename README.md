# PeerForm

It's inevitable, everyone has days when they don't feel like doing things related to fitness. Between going to the gym and cardio it is a very easy thing to skip. I believe I have found a full proof method to fix this, peer pressure. Think to yourself, if you skipped a day and at the end of the day you got a notification that your bestfriend went to the gym what's going to happen. Bad breakup? Imagine sitting in bed and seeing that your ex went to the gym while you are being lazy. Talk about instant motivation right there. If everyone you know is posting about going to the gym everyday, you are going to follow suit. At the end of the day 95% of the battle is showing up, this is app is not meant to be something to show off your workouts. It is simply a way to hopefully get more people up and about through the power of (good) peer pressure.

Users create an account, follow their friends, and then it begins. Every day users will get notifications about their friends completing workouts as well as other notifcations from the app if a user has not completed a workout by a chosen time on a day when they should have gone to gym.
